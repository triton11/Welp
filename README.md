# Welp
A trip planning tool built on top of Yelp and several other APIs.

# Instructions:
1. Run `node app` in terminal
2. Visit localhost:8080
3. When querying for an itinerary, make sure to choose every attribute. The database only has a large number of businesses from the cities of Phoenix, Toronto, Las Vegas and Pittsburgh, so query for those cities for the best results.
